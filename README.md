# signal-test

Tech test for signal media. The test was to write a function, `number-to-string`, that converts a positive integer into an english sentence. To test, either run `lein test`, or load the `signal-test.core` namespace in a repl and call the function from there.

Note: The function does not work with decimal numbers or negative numbers, and is not localised in any way.
